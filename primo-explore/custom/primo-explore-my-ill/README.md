## Install
1. Make sure you've installed and configured [primo-explore-devenv](https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-devenv).
2. Navigate to your template/central package root directory. For example:
    ```
    cd primo-explore/custom/MY_VIEW_ID
    ```
3. If you do not already have a `package.json` file in this directory, create one:
    ```
    npm init -y
    ```
4. Install this package:
    ```
    npm install primo-explore-my-ill --save-dev
    ```
5. Generate an ILLiad Web Platform API Key, as described [here](https://prometheus.atlas-sys.com/display/illiad/The+ILLiad+Web+Platform+API).

6. Deploy the php file to a server accessible to you. Edit lines 7, 10, and 11.

7. Place the .htaccess file in the same directory as your PHP file to add CORS authorization.

## Usage
Once this package is installed, add `my-ill` as a dependency for your custom module definition.

```js
var app = angular.module('viewCustom', ['my-ill'])
```

Note: If you're using the `--browserify` build option, you will need to first import the module with:

```javascript
import 'primo-explore-my-ill';
```

You can configure the banner by passing a configuration object. All properties are required.
